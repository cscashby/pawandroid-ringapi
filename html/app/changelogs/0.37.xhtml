<h1>Changelog - Version 0.37</h1>
<p>
This is mainly an Eclair/Froyo compatibility realease.
</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some server bugfixes concerning shutdown.</li>
  <li>Froyo no longer supports the restarting of packages, so the server shutdown has been changed.<br>This also affects the process list in the web app.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Web App</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A Froyo info message has been added to the process list application that stopping processes might not work as before, because restarting packages is no longer possible.</li>
  <li>READ_LOG permission has been added to the manifest, so logcat should now work again. This was broken for devices running Eclair.</li>
</ul>
